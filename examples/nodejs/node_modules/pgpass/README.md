# pgpass

[![Build Status](https://github.com/hoegaarden/pgpass/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/hoegaarden/pgpass/actions?query=workflow%3ACI+branch%3Amaster)

## Install

```sh
npm install pgpass
```

## Usage
```js
var pgPass = require('pgpass');

var connInfo = {
  'host' : 'pgserver' ,
  'user' : 'the_user_name' ,
};

pgPass(connInfo, function(pass){
  conn_info.password = pass;
  // connect to postgresql server
});
```

## Description

This module tries to read the `~/.pgpass` file (or the equivalent for windows systems). If the environment variable `PGPASSFILE` is set, this file is used instead. If everything goes right, the password from said file is passed to the callback; if the password cannot be read `undefined` is passed to the callback.

Cases where `undefined` is returned:

- the environment variable `PGPASSWORD` is set
- the file cannot be read (wrong permissions, no such file, ...)
- for non windows systems: the file is write-/readable by the group or by other users
- there is no matching line for the given connection info

There should be no need to use this module directly; it is already included in `node-postgres`.

## Configuration

The module reads the environment variable `PGPASS_NO_DEESCAPE` to decide if the the read tokens from the password file should be de-escaped or not. Default is to do de-escaping. For further information on this see [this commit](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/8d15e3ec4fcb735875a8a70a09ec0c62153c3329).


## Tests

There are tests in `./test/`; including linting and coverage testing. Running `npm test` runs:

- `jshint`
- `mocha` tests
- `jscoverage` and `mocha -R html-cov`

You can see the coverage report in `coverage.html`.
