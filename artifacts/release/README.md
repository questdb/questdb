# Release steps

This is a short guide to outline steps involved making QuestDB release.

## Compile release notes

Collect commit messages from git log and compile new `draft` release notes.
Please make sure not to publish it before `git` repo is ready.

When crafting new release note, please take previous release notes as style
guidelines. Releases should not look too dissimilar.

## Create a new branch from `master`

```bash
git fetch
git checkout master
git checkout -b v_7_1_1
```

## Clear previous release "memory"

```bash
mvn release:clean
```

## Perform release

This step will do the following:
- create tag in `git` repo
- roll the versions on your branch from one snapshot to the next, e.g. from 7.1.1-SNAPSHOT to 7.1.2-SNAPSHOT
- publish `jar` to maven central

Note: you will need write access to git repo and maven central.

```bash
mvn -B release:prepare release:perform
```

Note that `-B` flag will make assumptions about release version. Use it if your release is routine. When releasing
a special version, for example `8.0` you will want to remove `-B` and answer questions about versions in interactive
mode that follows.

## Compile binaries on multiple platforms

Compile using maven on Windows, Linux and FreeBSD and upload to GH release

```bash
git fetch --tags
git checkout tags/7.1.1
mvn clean package -DskipTests -P build-web-console,build-binaries
```

## Release Docker image

Prune docker images to ensure clean build

```
docker system prune -a
```

Build for multiple platforms at once and release version tag, `7.1.1` in this
case. This will take some time. Please note that tag is used twice in the command line:

```bash
cd core
docker buildx build --push --platform linux/arm64,linux/amd64 --tag questdb/questdb:7.1.1 --build-arg tag_name=7.1.1 .
```

Then build `latest`. This should be instant. Note tag name on the end of the command line.

```
docker buildx build --push --platform linux/arm64,linux/amd64 --tag questdb/questdb:latest --build-arg tag_name=7.1.1 .
```

## Release Java Library

Logging into https://oss.sonatype.org/ to release the library

## Release AMI

Our current AMI version has to be bumped with every release we do. This might change in the future, but for now
please follow these interactive steps to bump AMI:

snapshot
