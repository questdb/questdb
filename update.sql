/*The bug in the provided SQL query is the incorrect usage of the "ORDER BY" clause. The column "Date" is not included in the SELECT statement or the GROUP BY clause, so it cannot be referenced in the ORDER BY clause.
 To fix this, you can modify the query as follows:*/
SELECT Product_ID, SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Product_ID
ORDER BY Product_ID ASC;



/* In the fixed query, the ORDER BY clause is using the "Product_ID" column to sort the results in ascending order. This will return the total sales amount for each product, ordered by their respective IDs.

 If you also want to order the results by the latest date, you can include the "MAX(Date)" in the SELECT statement and use it in the ORDER BY clause:*/
SELECT Product_ID, SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales, MAX(Date) AS Latest_Date
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Product_ID
ORDER BY Latest_Date DESC;
