## News
__11 April 2016__ Change of licence

License changed from Apache 2.0 to AGPLv3. Please see LICENSE.txt for full details.

I feel very passionate about this project and I spend crazy amount of time to make it the best it can be. Yet I am having a day job, which is in no way helpful to my passion. AGPLv3 is a stepping stone to enable me to work on NFSdb full time and bring you guys the best database you have ever seen.

__9 June 2015__   Release roadmap

I realise that it has been a while since last release, but I would like to reassure the reader that this project is very much alive. The [roadmap for next](roadmap.md) release is quite large but we are chipping away from this list quite steadily. So stay with us!

__22 Jan 2015__.  3.0.0-SNAPSHOT is available for testing.

There is a number of exciting features planned for 3.0 release. Although main focus is on super-fast, functional query language and data accessibility, we have some interesting features ready to go:

- generic data access; for on-the-fly data definition and non-ORM data access
- write cluster and automatic failover for data producers

__14 Oct 2014__.  [Release 2.1.0](http://github.nfsdb.org/release-notes/) - stable

This is security-centric release aimed at having replication meet security standards. Features supported in this release are: SSL, Certificate auth (Mutual-auth), Shared Key Auth, Kerberso Auth, Kerberos SSO Auth (Windows only) and client auto-reconnect.
