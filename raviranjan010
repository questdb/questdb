What Has Been Fixed:
All assert false; statements in PGPipelineEntry.java have been replaced with:
Logging a critical error using LOG.critical(), so the issue is visible in server logs.
Throwing a BadProtocolException, which is a catchable exception and allows the server to handle the error gracefully instead of crashing.
How the Fix Addresses the Issue:
Instead of crashing the server, the code now logs a critical error and throws a protocol exception, allowing the connection to be closed safely and the error to be managed higher up the call stack.
