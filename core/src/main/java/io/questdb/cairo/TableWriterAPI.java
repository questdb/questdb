     * Adds new column to table, which can be either empty or can have data already. When existing columns
     * already have data this function will create ".top" file in addition to column files. ".top" file contains
     * size of partition at the moment of column creation. It must be used to accurately position inside new
     * column when either appending or reading.
     *
     * <b>Failures</b>
     * Adding new column can fail in many situations. None of the failures affect integrity of data that is already in
     * the table but can leave instance of TableWriter in inconsistent state. When this happens function will throw CairoError.
     * Calling code must close TableWriter instance and open another when problems are rectified. Those problems would be
     * either with disk or memory or both.
     * <p>
     * Whenever function throws CairoException application code can continue using TableWriter instance and may attempt to
     * add columns again.
     *
     * <b>Transactions</b>
     * <p>
     * Pending transaction will be committed before function attempts to add column. Even when function is unsuccessful it may
     * still have committed transaction.
     *
     * @param columnName              of column either ASCII or UTF8 encoded.
     * @param symbolCapacity          when column columnType is SYMBOL this parameter specifies approximate capacity for symbol map.
     *                                It should be equal to number of unique symbol values stored in the table and getting this
     *                                value badly wrong will cause performance degradation. Must be power of 2
     * @param symbolCacheFlag         when set to true, symbol values will be cached on Java heap.
     * @param columnType              {@link ColumnType}
     * @param isIndexed               configures column to be indexed or not
     * @param indexValueBlockCapacity approximation of number of rows for single index key, must be power of 2
