# Composite partitions: implementation state

Running record of what is BUILT, what is DECIDED, and where the work stands. Update this file in the same
commit as the change it describes.

Branch `lazy-geometry2`, worktree `questdb-wt-lazygeom2`, based on `f8cf9e468e` - the head of `master`.

## The goal

A partition can be several PIECES over one set of column files. Incoming rows are appended at the tail, the
pieces they do not touch are left exactly where they are, and the partition's geometry lives in a
`_geometry` file inside its own directory. `_txn` carries a pointer to it.

The model is parquet's, throughout: a composite partition is the parquet FILE, a piece is a ROW GROUP.
`_geometry` opens only when a query or a commit lands on THAT partition, exactly as row-group metadata is
read when a parquet partition is scanned and not at load.

## Why this is a second attempt

The first attempt (`questdb-wt-lazygeom`, branch `lazy-geometry`) built the same feature by growing it out
of an existing partition-split implementation. That left an expansion step in `TxReader` - every `_txn`
load read every composite partition's `_geometry` and spliced the results into one flat piece list - and a
piece-indexed API spread across ~160 call sites in `TableWriter` alone. Removing the expansion meant
converting all of them first, so the lazy read could never actually land.

This tree starts from clean `master` and adds only what is needed, in dependency order. **The expansion is
deliberately not ported.** `attachedPartitions` stays exactly as master has it: one 4-long record per
partition. Every index in the new code is the ordinary partition index, and the word "piece" appears only
inside `PartitionGeometry`, the planner, the executor and the two frame cursors that consume it.

## Status

| # | item | state |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `PartitionGeometryFile` - the `_geometry` codec | **BUILT** |
| 2 | `_txn` slot 3 carries the composite flag + offset | **BUILT** |
| 3 | `PartitionGeometry` - the lazy resolver | **BUILT** |
| 4 | Read path: map `[0, E)`, one frame per piece | **BUILT**, untested against a real composite partition |
| 5 | `processCompositePartition` + the decision list | **BUILT** |
| 6 | Transaction clustering feeding the cut list | **BUILT**, 11 tests |
| 7 | `FrameAlgebra.merge` | **BUILT** for fixed-width columns |
| 8 | Executor: KEEP / NEW_PIECE / MERGE | **BUILT** |
| 9 | Geometry pointer back through the partition sink | **BUILT** |
| 10 | Routing behind `cairo.o3.partition.merge.append.enabled` | **BUILT**, default OFF |
| 11 | End-to-end test | **RED** - see below |
| 12 | Var-size column merge | NOT STARTED |
| 13 | Index maintenance for merged rows | NOT STARTED |

With the flag off - the default - nothing above is reachable and the tree behaves exactly as master.

## WHERE THE WORK STANDS

`O3CompositePartitionTest` is RED. Both cases fail at the same assertion - the table is SUSPENDED after
`drainWalQueue()`, before any row is compared. So the apply throws; this is a write-side fault, not a read
one.

**The apply's error has not been read yet.** That is the next step and it is one run away: run
`O3CompositePartitionTest` and capture the critical log line around the suspension, which names the throw
directly. Everything below this line is inference and should be treated as such until that is done.

Two things are known rather than inferred:

- the second case (`testChronologicalAppendRewritesNothing`) produces only KEEP and NEW_PIECE - no MERGE at
  all - and suspends too. So the fault is NOT in the merge kernel. It is in the append, the geometry
  publish, or the sink hand-off;
- an earlier failure at the same point was a JVM SIGSEGV inside `mergeTwoLongIndexesAsc`, caused by a
  helper that fetched the piece's timestamp address inside try-with-resources: closing the `FrameColumn`
  released the mapping, and the index build then walked freed memory. Fixed in `e5a8f69414` - the column
  now stays open across both the index build and the merge, which is the only window the address is valid
  in. The current failure is a clean throw, not that.

A guess I made and should NOT be trusted without evidence: that the empty table root in `TxWriter` was the
stopper. `8572f15955` removes that possibility entirely - the writer no longer needs a root - and the tests
fail identically, so either it was never the cause or there is a second one behind it.

## Decisions

### `_txn` carries the pointer; the OWNERS do the I/O

`TxReader` and `TxWriter` carry the composite flag and the `_geometry` offset in and out of slot 3, and
reach no file. The resolver belongs to `TableReader` (reads) and `TableWriter` (writes), which already know
the table's path. Each creates it on first use, so a table with no composite partition allocates nothing.

Slot 3 of a NATIVE record is 1 composite bit, 19 generation bits and a 44-bit byte offset. It stays the
parquet FILE SIZE whenever either parquet bit of slot 1 is set, so every read of it checks that first - a
parquet partition is materialized whole and is never composite.

### Non-composite is not a special case

A partition with no geometry is the ONE-PIECE case: the piece starts at the partition's own timestamp, at
file row 0, and spans every row it holds. The plan takes that as input like any other, and the moment it
cuts, the partition IS composite. The cut costs one extra entry over files that never move. So promotion
happens in flight, and there is no conversion step and no code that exists only to perform one.

### Two cut sources, different questions

Transaction clustering (`WalTxnClusterer`) bins the partition's range into strides, marks every bin an
incoming transaction covers as hot, and cuts at the edges of the cold gaps worth keeping. It sees the whole
block, so it spares data no single batch straddles. The batch edges then cut around where one batch lands
inside a piece. Clustering runs first, as the coarser division.

A clustering cut is a TIMESTAMP, not a piece index - it was chosen from incoming work, not from the piece
list - so `applyCutAt` locates the piece containing it, re-finding it per call so cuts are
order-independent, and declines a timestamp no piece holds rather than guessing.

### One writer at E, any number of readers below it

Everything is written at the TAIL, above every row the partition already holds, so nothing live is
overwritten and a reader pinned on the old geometry keeps addressing the bytes it always did.

Each MERGE opens its OWN read-only frame reaching no further than `rowOffset + rowCount` of the piece it
reads. Sizing the mapping to the piece rather than to `E` is what keeps the cost proportional to the data
being rewritten, which is the claim the design rests on. KEEP opens nothing at all.

### The plan carries row OFFSETS, not just sizes

The executor reads a piece straight out of the files, so it has to know where the piece IS. A cut splits
the offset with the rest: both halves address the same files at the same places, so the lower half keeps
the offset it had and the upper half starts that many rows further in.

An earlier version read at the piece's CUMULATIVE row, which is only correct while nothing has ever been
rewritten - exactly the state this design stops being true.

### Column tops belong to the column

Each side of a merge offsets by its OWN top, as `append` already does:

```java
source1Lo -= sourceColumn1.getColumnTop();
source2Lo -= sourceColumn2.getColumnTop();
appendOffsetRowCount -= columnTop;
```

A row below a column's top is not in that column's file, so the top is the gap between the row a caller
names and the row the file holds - and the column is what knows it. Nothing a level up reasons about them.

## Known gaps

- **Var-size columns**: `ContiguousFileVarFrameColumn.merge` throws. The aux vector and data offsets need
  `oooMergeCopyStrColumn` / `VarcharColumn` / `ArrayColumn`. Deferred deliberately - fixed columns first,
  to catch the structural bugs on the simpler case.
- **Indexed columns**: `ContiguousFileIndexedFrameColumn` inherits the fixed merge, but index entries for
  merged rows are not maintained.
- **`NEW_PIECE`'s floor**: the executor records the new piece's `tsLo` as the batch's FIRST timestamp, not
  the lower bound of the gap it fills. So a later row landing between the previous piece's `tsHi` and this
  piece's `tsLo` routes to the previous piece. This needs deciding deliberately rather than by accident.
- **Dedup**: the plan has no dedup term at all. `liveRows` is the plain sum of piece rows.

## Working notes

- `JAVA_HOME` must be Java 25: `/opt/homebrew/opt/java/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home`.
  `/usr/libexec/java_home` returns 24.0.2 and maven-enforcer rejects it.
- `mvn -Dtest='A+B+C'` selects NOTHING and passes vacuously with `failIfNoTests=false`. Use
  `-Dtest.include="%regex[.*(A|B).*]"` and confirm against the MTIMES of `core/target/surefire-reports/*.txt`.
- A JVM crash leaves `core/hs_err_pid*.log` in the worktree; its "Problematic frame" plus the Java frames
  under it name the offending call directly, which is faster than reasoning about the native side.
- Do not edit source while a maven build is running - it fails in unrelated files.
