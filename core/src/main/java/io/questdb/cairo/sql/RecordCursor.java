/**
 * A cursor interface for sequential iteration over database records in QuestDB.
 * <p>
 * RecordCursor provides a standardized way to iterate through query results, supporting
 * various access patterns including forward iteration, random access, and optimized
 * operations like size calculation and top-K queries. It extends Closeable for proper
 * resource management and SymbolTableSource for symbol column access.
 * <p>
 * Key features:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Sequential record iteration with {@link #hasNext()} and {@link #getRecord()}</li>
 * <li>Dual record access with {@link #getRecord()} and {@link #getRecordB()} for comparisons</li>
 * <li>Random access positioning with {@link #recordAt(Record, long)}</li>
 * <li>Efficient row skipping with {@link #skipRows(Counter)}</li>
 * <li>Size calculation with circuit breaker support</li>
 * <li>Symbol table access for symbol columns</li>
 * <li>Optimized top-K operations for ORDER BY + LIMIT queries</li>
 * <li>Cursor reset functionality with {@link #toTop()}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Resource Management:</strong><br>
 * This interface extends {@link Closeable} and is not optionally-closeable.
 * The {@link #close()} method must be called after all operations are complete
 * to ensure proper resource cleanup.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Thread Safety:</strong><br>
 * RecordCursor implementations are generally not thread-safe. For concurrent
 * access, use {@link #newSymbolTable(int)} to create thread-local symbol table instances.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Exception Handling:</strong><br>
 * Many operations may throw {@link DataUnavailableException} when accessing
 * partitions stored in cold storage or when data is temporarily unavailable.
