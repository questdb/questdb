/**
 * This class maintains cache of open writers to avoid OS overhead of
 * opening and closing files. While doing so it abides by the the same
 * rule as non-pooled writers: there can only be one TableWriter instance
 * for any given name.
 * <p>
 * This implementation is thread-safe. Writer allocated by one thread
 * cannot be used by any other threads until it is released. This factory
 * will be returning NULL when writer is already in use and cached
 * instance of writer otherwise. Writers are released back to pool via
 * standard writer.close() call.
 * <p>
 * Writers that have been idle for some time can be expunged from pool
 * by calling Job.run() method asynchronously. Pool implementation is
 * guaranteeing thread-safety of this method at all times.
 * <p>
 * This factory can be closed via close() call. This method is also
 * thread-safe and is guarantying that all open writers will be eventually
 * closed.
