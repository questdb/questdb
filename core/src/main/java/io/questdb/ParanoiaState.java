     * <pre>
     * BASIC -> validates UTF-8 in log records (throws a LogError if invalid),
     *          throws a LogError on abandoned log records (missing .$() at the end of log statement),
     *          detects closed stdout in LogConsoleWriter.
     *          This introduces a low overhead to logging.
     * AGGRESSIVE -> BASIC + holds recent history of log lines to help diagnose closed stdout,
     *               holds the stack trace of abandoned log record.
     *               This introduces a significant overhead to logging.
     *
     * When running inside JUnit/Surefire, BASIC log paranoia mode gets activated automatically.
     * You can manually edit the code in the static { } block below to activate AGGRESSIVE instead.
     *
     * Logs may go silent when Maven Surefire plugin closes stdout due to broken text encoding.
     * In BASIC mode, the log writer will detect this and print errors through System.out, which
     * under Surefire uses an alternate channel and not stdout.
     * In AGGRESSIVE mode, it will additionally remember the most recent log lines and print them.
     * This will help you find the offending log line with broken encoding.
     *
     * The logging framework detects a common coding error where you forget to end a log statement
     * with .$(), causing the statement not to be logged. This problem can only be detected after
     * the fact, when you start a new log record and the previous one wasn't completed.
     *
     * With Log Paranoia off (LOG_PARANOIA_MODE_NONE), we only detect this problem and print an
     * error message.
     * In BASIC mode, we throw a LogError without a stack trace.
     * In AGGRESSIVE mode, we capture the stack trace at every start of a log statement, so when
     * we throw the LogError, it points to the code that created and then abandoned the log record.
