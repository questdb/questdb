/**
 * <h2>A floating point values High Dynamic Range (HDR) Histogram that uses a packed internal representation</h2>
 * <p>
 * It is important to note that {@link PackedDoubleHistogram} is not thread-safe, and does not support safe concurrent
 * recording by multiple threads.
 * <p>
 * {@link PackedDoubleHistogram} tracks value counts in a packed internal representation optimized
 * for typical histogram recoded values are sparse in the value range and tend to be incremented in small unit counts.
 * This packed representation tends to require significantly smaller amounts of stoarge when compared to unpacked
 * representations, but can incur additional recording cost due to resizing and repacking operations that may
 * occur as previously unrecorded values are encountered.
 * <p>
 * {@link PackedDoubleHistogram} supports the recording and analyzing sampled data value counts across a
 * configurable dynamic range of floating point (double) values, with configurable value precision within the range.
 * Dynamic range is expressed as a ratio between the highest and lowest non-zero values trackable within the histogram
 * at any given time. Value precision is expressed as the number of significant [decimal] digits in the value recording,
 * and provides control over value quantization behavior across the value range and the subsequent value resolution at
 * any given level.
 * <p>
 * Auto-ranging: Unlike integer value based histograms, the specific value range tracked by a {@link
 * PackedDoubleHistogram} is not specified upfront. Only the dynamic range of values that the histogram can cover is
 * (optionally) specified. E.g. When a {@link PackedDoubleHistogram} is created to track a dynamic range of
 * 3600000000000 (enough to track values from a nanosecond to an hour), values could be recorded into into it in any
 * consistent unit of time as long as the ratio between the highest and lowest non-zero values stays within the
 * specified dynamic range, so recording in units of nanoseconds (1.0 thru 3600000000000.0), milliseconds (0.000001
 * thru 3600000.0) seconds (0.000000001 thru 3600.0), hours (1/3.6E12 thru 1.0) will all work just as well.
 * <p>
 * Auto-resizing: When constructed with no specified dynamic range (or when auto-resize is turned on with {@link
 * DoubleHistogram#setAutoResize}) a {@link DoubleHistogram} will auto-resize its dynamic range to
 * include recorded values as they are encountered. Note that recording calls that cause auto-resizing may take
 * longer to execute, as resizing incurs allocation and copying of internal data structures.
 * <p>
 * Attempts to record non-zero values that range outside of the specified dynamic range (or exceed the limits of
 * of dynamic range when auto-resizing) may results in {@link CairoException} exceptions, either
 * due to overflow or underflow conditions. These exceptions will only be thrown if recording the value would have
 * resulted in discarding or losing the required value precision of values already recorded in the histogram.
 * <p>
 * See package description for {@link io.questdb.std.histogram.org.HdrHistogram} for details.
