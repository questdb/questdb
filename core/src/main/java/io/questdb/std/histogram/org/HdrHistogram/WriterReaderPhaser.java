/**
 * {@link WriterReaderPhaser} provides an asymmetric means for
 * synchronizing the execution of wait-free "writer" critical sections against
 * a "reader phase flip" that needs to make sure no writer critical sections
 * that were active at the beginning of the flip are still active after the
 * flip is done.  Multiple writers and multiple readers are supported.
 * <p>
 * Using a {@link WriterReaderPhaser} for coordination, writers can continously
 * perform wait-free/lock-free updates to common data structures, while readers
 * can get hold of atomic and inactive snapshots without stalling writers.
 * <p>
 * While a {@link WriterReaderPhaser} can be useful in multiple scenarios, a
 * specific and common use case is that of safely managing "double buffered"
 * data stream access in which writers can proceed without being blocked, while
 * readers gain access to stable and unchanging buffer samples.
 * {@link WriterReaderPhaser} "writers" are wait free (on architectures that support
 * wait free atomic increment operations), "readers" block for other
 * "readers", and "readers" are only blocked by "writers" whose critical section
 * was entered before the reader's
 * {@link WriterReaderPhaser#flipPhase()} attempt.
 * <h2>Assumptions and Guarantees</h2>
 * <p>
 * When used to protect an actively recording data structure, the assumptions on
 * how readers and writers act are:
 * <ol>
 * <li>There are two sets of data structures ("active" and "inactive")</li>
 * <li>Writing is done to the perceived active version (as perceived by the
 *     writer), and only within critical sections delineated by
 *     {@link WriterReaderPhaser#writerCriticalSectionEnter} and
 *     {@link WriterReaderPhaser#writerCriticalSectionExit writerCriticalSectionExit()}.
 *     </li>
 * <li>Only readers switch the perceived roles of the active and inactive data
 *     structures. They do so only while under {@link WriterReaderPhaser#readerLock()}
 *     protection and only before calling {@link WriterReaderPhaser#flipPhase()}.</li>
 * <li>Writers do not remain in their critical sections indefinitely.</li>
 * <li>Only writers perform {@link WriterReaderPhaser#writerCriticalSectionEnter}
 *     and
 *     {@link WriterReaderPhaser#writerCriticalSectionExit writerCriticalSectionExit()}.
 * </li>
 * <li>Readers do not hold onto readerLock indefinitely.</li>
 * <li>Only readers perform {@link WriterReaderPhaser#readerLock()} and
 * {@link WriterReaderPhaser#readerUnlock()}.</li>
 * <li>Only readers perform {@link WriterReaderPhaser#flipPhase()} operations,
 * and only while holding the readerLock.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * When the above assumptions are met, {@link WriterReaderPhaser} guarantees
 * that the inactive data structures are not being modified by any writers while
 * being read while under readerLock() protection after a
 * {@link WriterReaderPhaser#flipPhase()}() operation.
 * <p>
 * The following progress guarantees are provided to writers and readers that
 * adhere to the above stated assumptions:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Writers operations
 * ({@link WriterReaderPhaser#writerCriticalSectionEnter writerCriticalSectionEnter}
 * and {@link WriterReaderPhaser#writerCriticalSectionExit writerCriticalSectionExit})
 * are wait free on architectures that
 * support wait-free atomic increment operations (they remain lock-free [but not
 * wait-free] on architectures that do not support wait-free atomic increment
 * operations)</li>
 * <li>{@link WriterReaderPhaser#flipPhase()} operations are guaranteed to
 * make forward progress, and will only be blocked by writers whose critical sections
 * were entered prior to the start of the reader's flipPhase operation, and have not
 * yet exited their critical sections.</li>
 * <li>{@link WriterReaderPhaser#readerLock()} only blocks for other
 * readers that are holding the readerLock.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Example use</h2>
 * Imagine a simple use case where a histogram (which is basically a large set of
 * rapidly updated counters) is being modified by writers, and a reader needs to gain
 * access to stable interval samples of the histogram for reporting or other analysis
 * purposes.
 * <pre><code>
 *         final WriterReaderPhaser recordingPhaser = new WriterReaderPhaser();
 *
 *         volatile Histogram activeHistogram;
 *         Histogram inactiveHistogram;
 *         ...
 * </code></pre>
 * A writer may record values the histogram:
 * <pre><code>
 *         // Wait-free recording:
 *         long criticalValueAtEnter = recordingPhaser.writerCriticalSectionEnter();
 *         try {
 *             activeHistogram.recordValue(value);
 *         } finally {
 *             recordingPhaser.writerCriticalSectionExit(criticalValueAtEnter);
 *         }
 * </code></pre>
 * A reader gains access to a stable histogram of values recorded during an interval,
 * and reports on it:
 * <pre><code>
 *         try {
 *             recordingPhaser.readerLock();
 *
 *             inactiveHistogram.reset();
 *
 *             // Swap active and inactive histograms:
 *             final Histogram tempHistogram = inactiveHistogram;
 *             inactiveHistogram = activeHistogram;
 *             activeHistogram = tempHistogram;
 *
 *             recordingPhaser.flipPhase();
 *             // At this point, inactiveHistogram content is guaranteed to be stable
 *
 *             logHistogram(inactiveHistogram);
 *
 *         } finally {
 *             recordingPhaser.readerUnlock();
 *         }
 * </code></pre>
 */
/*
 * High level design: There are even and odd epochs; the epoch flips for each
 * reader.  Any number of writers can be in the same epoch (odd or even), but
 * after a completed phase flip no writers will be still in the old epoch
 * (and therefor are known to not be updating or observing the old, inactive
 * data structure). Writers can always proceed at full speed in what they
 * percieve to be the current (odd or even) epoch. The epoch flip is fast (a
 * single atomic op).
