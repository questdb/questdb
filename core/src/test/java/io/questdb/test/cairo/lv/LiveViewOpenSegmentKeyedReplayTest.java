/**
 * Coverage for the repair of a correction that lands in the <b>open</b> anchor segment -
 * the one the runtime is still standing in, which the resume repairs by replaying every
 * base row above its anchor.
 * <p>
 * That resume is where the reported workload's volume is: under a daily anchor almost every
 * late commit is shallower than a day, so it lands in the open segment, and the per-segment
 * scoping, the keyed replay and the sparse publication all decline by construction. What
 * these cases pin is the route that reaches it - the open segment's own key domain, and the
 * pricing that decides whether following those keys reads less than reading every row above
 * the anchor.
