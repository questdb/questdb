# HTTP server port, defaults to 80
http.port=9000

# Number of worker threads
http.threads=2

# Idle connection timeout in millis
http.timeout=15000

# Max number of simultaneous connections
# server will be refusing new connections once
# number of open sockets is above max
# New connections are allowed in once existing ones
# disconnect for three reasons:
# - idle over timeout
# - client disconnected gracefully
# - client kicked out for bad behaviour
#
# default value is 128
http.max.connections=128

# HTTP request header buffer size
# maximum size of incoming header, requests with header larger
# than buffer can accommodate will be rejected with HTTP/431
# Consider that in cases such as Kerberos authentication,
# request headers can be quite large.
http.buf.req.header=64K

# HTTP content buffer size
# Content buffer is allocated per connection. Its size is a trade-off
# between performance of data import and memory consumption by server
http.buf.req.content=4M

# HTTP multipart request header size
# Usually multipart headers are quite small, so 1K should be more than enough
# In cases where multipart header is too small for the request server will return HTTP/400
http.buf.req.multipart=1K


http.buf.resp.header=1K
http.buf.resp.content=1M

# sample.ks is a demo keystore, you should change it
