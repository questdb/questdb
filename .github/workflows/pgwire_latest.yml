name: PGWire - Latest clients
# Testing PGWire with the latest versions of clients
# So we are notified of any issues with just released versions
# It's intentionally not triggered on every PR since we do not want
# CI to fail if a new version of a client is released and it's not compatible
# Instead, we want to be notified asynchronously, e.g. via Slack
